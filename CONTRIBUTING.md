This project uses [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to manage versioning. Please, follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) pattern to ensure a good versioning of your change.

A release is done only when your commit fallows the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) pattern, which has the follow format:

```
fix(context): Message
```

eg:

```
fix(button): Fixing button shadows
```

```
feat(321): Including new icon
```

Commits tagged with `fix` will create a `patch` version and with `feat` will create a `minor` version. Major versions will be created when any commit is tagged as `BREAKING CHANGE`.
